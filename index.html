        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> In this project, our group designed an interactive interface for an emerging startup, undergoing the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup’s concept. The interface we developed was a web application that served both as a company website as well as a platform for the company’s technology. </p>

        <h3>About The Company</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> The startup we chose is Apply Design, a modern online editor for property sellers that enables users to apply virtual staging on images of their home. Apply Design’s core technology is an AI program that allows users to automatically generate 3D renderings of various furniture, decoration, and other design elements in a realistic way. The company claims to help users sell their homes 30% faster at a 5% higher price by showcasing the home in a more personalized setting to buyers, without the hassle of hiring an interior design team. So far, more than 100,000 images have been created through Apply Design for over 10,000 properties in 25 different countries by top realtors from Keller Williams, Re/Max, and other distinguished real estate franchises.

        <h3>First Design Iteration: Initial Sketches</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> First, we wanted to brainstorm possible layouts for Apply Design's website. Thus, for this design iteration, each of our four group members drew sketches to visualize what the final website design could look like. </p>

        <h3>Second Design Iteration: Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> Upon creating the initial sketches, our group discussed whether they addressed the company's needs. The company's main goal is to create a user-friendly experience for homeowners to virtually stage their homes. Thus, we determined that two must-have pages are a Create page where the user creates their design and a Gallery page where the user can view previous examples. In addition, we also included a Home page to introduce the website and an About page to introduce the company itself. With these four pages in mind, we used Figma to create a low-fidelity prototype.  </p>
        <p class="text-center" style="margin-top: 50px;"> Home Page </p>

        <h3>Third Design Iteration: High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> In our third design iteration, we built upon the low-fidelity prototype to create a high-fidelity prototype on Figma. This prototype is an interactive web page that allows users to see the entire user experience of Apply Design's website. </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"> The video below demonstrates the user experience of our third design iteration. Click on the full-screen button to better view the video. </p>

        </div>
        <p style="padding-top:20px;"> After creating this prototype, we participated in a mockup crit and received feedback from our peers and UI/UX industry experts.
        The main feedback we received was for the Create page. Users felt that the flow from importing an image to creating a design should be more clear. Specifically, one comment was that users should not be able to choose different pieces of furniture without having imported a photo yet. Furthermore, users suggested that pop-up screens included X-buttons to exit the pop-up.
        Lastly, one user mentioned that the ability to switch between a 2-D view and a 3-D view would be helpful for visual staging. </p>

        <h3>Fourth Design Iteration: The Final Website</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> For our final design iteration, we incorporated feedback from the mockup crit to our website. Specifcally, we redesigned the Create page to show a clearer flow. Users first have to import an image before choosing any furniture. Then, they can switch between a 2-D view and a 3-D view to stage their home. In addition, users can preview and download their finalized designs or remove the photo to create a new design.
          In the About page, we removed the social media icons to avoid repetition.  </p>

      <div class="container" style="padding-top: 80px;">
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> After finishing our final iteration, we used User Testing to have three users interact with our design. We provided them with the following testing instructions and tasks before letting them explore the website. </p>
        <p> <strong> Testing Instructions: </strong> </p>
        <p> Imagine you are a homeowner looking to stage your home before you list it for sale. Your objective is to create a design for the furniture in your house.
          We encourage you to think aloud as you navigate the prototype.
          (Please note this is an interactive mockup and NOT an actual website.)</p>

        <p> <strong> Tasks: </strong> </p>
        <p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website? Explain your answer.</li>
            <li>Without leaving the homepage, describe what you would select first. (Do not select anything yet.) If you would leave without clicking anywhere, please explain why.</li>
            <li>Find the CEO of Apply Design.</li>
            <li>Walk through the process of creating a design. Specifically, complete the following:

              a) Upload the sample photo.
              b) Look through the different furniture.
              c) Preview your designed home.
              d) Download your rendered photo.</li>
         </ol>
        </p>

        <p> <strong> Post-Test Questions: </strong> </p>
        <p><ol type="1">
          <li>What frustrated you most about this site?</li>
          <li>If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site? </li>
          <li>What did you like about the site? Was it memorable?</li>
          <li>When you were designing your home, were you ever unsure how to proceed? Were you ever unsure which button to click?</li>
       </ol></p>

    <!-- Results -->
    <section id="user-results">

      <div class="container" style="padding-top: 50px;">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> Overall, all three users liked the clean aesthetic of the website and found it user-friendly.
          They were able to successfully complete each of the tasks assigned to them.
          Referencing the different tasks outlined in the previous section, users spent the most time and made the most clicks on the fourth task – walking through the process of creating a design. 
          This result aligned with our expectations because the Create section contains the most number of pop-up screens and interactions. The main error that users made was attempting to drag 
          the furniture they chose to their imported image when creating the design. Since our website is only a prototype, it does not support the actual design functionality yet.
          However, we hope that our progress can help Apply Design better understand different users' needs and potentially include parts of our design when implementing their Create page. </p>

    <!-- Final Thoughts -->
    <section id="final-thoughts">

      <div class="container" style="padding-top: 50px;">
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"> Overall, we were able to learn about mocking up a solution in terms of the different stages of design. Specifically, we learned about working together in a team and designing collaboratively, which was not something we had done before in this class. It was very interesting to collaborate on Figma in real time and work on different parts of the design at the same time. Additionally, we learned about how critiques work in the real world through our critique session with an industry expert.
